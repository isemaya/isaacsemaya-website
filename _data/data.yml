    intro:
      This was for CS1951-A (Introduction to Data Science) at Brown. I worked with Michael Xu and Hilery Chao to create a suite of visualizations that analyze user's Facebook messages, using their own personal "big data."
      - Extracted raw messages from HTML files and counted Facebook messages, visualizing frequencies in Python and D3.js to compare frequency of 70,000 messages sent during daytime versus nighttime.
      - Developed webpage in Flask to run Python scripts that parsed messages and displayed 8 D3.js visualizations.
      - Mapped messages as "bag of words" to train machine learning model (using the Random Forest algorithm) to
   predict 1 friend out of 500+ most associated with contents of message.
