Hi there! 初めまして！

My name is Isaac Semaya, and I grew up in Tokyo, Japan and London, United Kingdom.
I graduated from <a href="https://www.brown.edu/">Brown University</a> in May 2018 with a Bachelor of Science degree in <a href="http://cs.brown.edu/">Computer Science</a>.

I'm currently based in the Bay Area and am aspiring to be a Software Engineer! I'm open to any opportunities that might arise.
